		<h1>Hi, my love</h1>
		<p>hi, babe. honestly, i don’t know what to say right now except— i love you the most.
			we had our arguments, misunderstanding, and fights.
			but, what’s important is every time we have so, we always fix it. 
			we don’t let ourselves sleep with a burden heart and heavy minds. 
			im really thankful that i have someone who couldn’t bring to let me
			sleep with such heavy thoughts, you have been the peace that the gods offered me. 
			now that we are one month more to eternity, i am certain that i will
			only love you— genuinely and unconditionally. my love, we had our
			silent battles and challenges, and i know we still have a long way to go. 
			however, as long as im with you and you are with me, we will face everything
			together. without doubt, my world will revolve around us— for you are my 
			strength and my pride. happy happy 4th month to us, baby. i love you, body
			and soul, and i would do anything to keep you in my arms forever. </p>
